# Covbot

## Description
This repository contains the source code for Covbot, a chatbot that is able to answer basic queries about about COVID statistics (regarding vaccinations and positive cases). This bot was created by me (Laurenz Stampfl) for my bachelor thesis.

The bot is split up into two components that work independently from each other. The frontend consists of a web interface created with Vue.js that allows the user to interact with the bot in a web browser. The backend was created using Python.
