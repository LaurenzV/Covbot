# Covbot

## Description
This repository contains the source code for Covbot, 
a chatbot that is able to answer basic queries about COVID statistics. 
This bot was created by me (Laurenz Stampfl) as part of my bachelor thesis. You can find a video
of the bot in action [here](https://youtu.be/0_31WEyXBW4).
